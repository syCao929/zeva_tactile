MoE Stability Callback
======================
Monitors whether the MoE router is staying healthy over the course of training.
A healthy router distributes tokens reasonably evenly, keeps all experts alive,
and remains uncertain enough (high entropy) that it is still learning to route.

The following metrics are tracked per layer, per tower (und / gen):

  Dead Expert Rate
  ----------------
  Fraction of experts receiving fewer than 10% of their fair-share of tokens
  (i.e. load fraction f_i < 0.1 / N). A dead expert has been effectively shut
  out by the router — it gets no gradient signal and its capacity is wasted.
  Ideal = 0. A rising dead-expert rate in the gen tower during early training
  is a common failure mode.

  Load Imbalance Factor (LIF)
  ---------------------------
  N * max(f_i), where f_i is the fraction of tokens routed to expert i.
  Measures how much the busiest expert is overloaded relative to uniform.
  LIF = 1.0 is perfect balance; <= 1.3 is healthy; > 3.0 indicates severe
  collapse onto a small set of experts. This is the same quantity watched by
  the load-balancing loss, but measured empirically rather than from the loss
  objective.

  Router Entropy (normalized)
  ---------------------------
  Mean per-token Shannon entropy of the full routing distribution, divided by
  log(N) to put it on a [0, 1] scale. H = 1 means the router is maximally
  uncertain (uniform over all experts); H = 0 means it always picks the same
  expert. Early in training entropy is high; we want it to stay reasonably
  high (> ~0.7) so the router continues to explore. A sudden drop signals
  routing collapse.

  Soft-vs-Hard Effective Experts (normalized)
  -------------------------------------------
  Soft and hard effective experts separate what the router *considers* (full
  probability distribution, before dispatch) from what top-k dispatch *actually
  uses* (empirical token-to-expert assignment, after dispatch). Both are
  expressed as a fraction of N, so they sit on the same axis as
  router_entropy_normalized. Their lower bounds differ slightly:
    soft_eff_normalized is bounded in [1/N, 1].
    hard_eff_normalized is bounded in [K/N, 1] — top-K dispatch always engages
      at least K experts in aggregate (the floor case is when every token
      picks the same K-expert subset).

      soft_eff_normalized = mean_t exp(H(p_t)) / N
        Average per-token router perplexity, divided by N. Asks: what fraction
        of experts is the router *considering* on a typical token? Computed
        as sum_per_token_soft_eff / total_tokens / N. Note: the unnormalized
        numerator is NOT exp of the mean entropy — by Jensen,
        mean_t exp(H_t) >= exp(mean_t H_t), and the gap matters when
        per-token entropies are heterogeneous.

      hard_eff_normalized = exp(H(f)) / N
        where f_i is the empirical fraction of *expert assignments* (not
        tokens) that went to expert i: f_i = tokens_per_expert_i / (T * K).
        Perplexity of the buffer-wide dispatch distribution, divided by N.
        Asks: what fraction of experts is top-k *actually* engaging across the
        buffer? A smoother sibling of LIF: where LIF watches the busiest
        expert, hard_eff watches the spread of the whole load distribution.

  Interpretation (high/low refer to values close to 1 vs close to 1/N):

      high soft_eff, high hard_eff
        Router considers many experts; top-k dispatch also uses many experts.
        Broadly healthy routing.
      low  soft_eff, low  hard_eff
        Router is confident or collapsed in probability space; dispatch is
        also concentrated. Entropy, LIF, and hard usage all agree that
        routing is narrow.
      high soft_eff, low  hard_eff
        Router distribution is broad, but top-k dispatch is concentrated —
        the "hidden top-k concentration" case where entropy can look healthy
        while LIF and co-activation are high.
      low  soft_eff, high hard_eff
        Less common: each token has a sharp router distribution, but
        different tokens choose different experts. Per-token confidence with
        buffer-wide diversity.

  Honest Effective Experts (N_eff) and Effective Parameters
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  Uses the soft clean gate g[t, e] (the pre-dispatch softmax over experts, summing
  to 1 per token) to estimate how many experts a layer *honestly* uses, discounting
  coverage that isn't actually token-driven.

      P[e]      = mean_t g[t, e]                      # marginal usage distribution
      H_marg    = -sum_e P[e] ln P[e]                 # entropy of overall usage (nats)
      H_within  = mean_t ( -sum_e g[t,e] ln g[t,e] )  # avg per-token entropy (nats)
      N_cov     = exp(H_marg)                          # coverage, in [1, N]
      rho       = (H_marg - H_within) / H_marg         # conditionality, in [0, 1]
      N_eff     = k + (N_cov - k) * rho                # honest experts, in [~k, N]

  N_eff is logged normalized as honest_eff_normalized = N_eff / N (a fraction in
  [~k/N, 1]), sitting on the same axis as soft_eff_normalized / hard_eff_normalized.

  rho (logged as router_token_mi_normalized) is the normalized mutual information between
  token identity and expert routing:
  rho -> 1 when routing is genuinely token-dependent, rho -> 0 when every token routes
  the same way (so wide coverage that is not input-driven is not rewarded). By concavity
  of entropy H_marg >= H_within, so rho >= 0; rho is defined as 0 when H_marg = 0. N_eff
  can fall below k if usage collapses onto fewer than k experts (N_cov < k).

  Effective Parameters (per tower) summarizes N_eff at the model level:

      Effective Parameters = Shared Parameters + sum_l ( N_eff[l] * Per-Expert Parameters )

  where Shared Parameters is the non-expert LLM backbone (token embeddings, lm_head,
  final norm, and per-layer attention + norms + router gate), derived analytically from
  the generator text config; the vision tower and diffusion adapters are excluded, so the
  number reflects the effective LLM size. Per-Expert Parameters is one expert's gate_up +
  down projection size, and the sum runs over this tower's MoE layers. It interpolates
  between the active size (all N_eff == k, e.g. ~A3B / ~A22B) and the full size (all
  N_eff == N, e.g. 30B / 235B).

Buffer ownership
----------------
  This callback is fully self-contained: it reads and resets its own dedicated
  buffers (stability_tokens_per_expert, stability_total_tokens, sum_token_entropy,
  sum_per_token_soft_eff, sum_router_prob_per_expert). It does not depend on
  ExpertHeatmap's reset cycle.

class MoEStabilityCallback(EveryN):
    """
    Logs per-layer MoE stability metrics to W&B every N training steps.

    What it captures
    ----------------
    Whether the MoE router remains in a healthy, balanced state over training.
    The metrics collectively answer: are all experts still being used
    (dead_expert_rate), is load spread evenly (lif), is the router still
    making uncertain, exploratory decisions (router_entropy_normalized), and
    do the experts the router considers (soft_eff) match the experts top-k
    dispatch actually engages (hard_eff)?

    W&B layout
    ----------
    For each per-layer metric and each tower, two kinds of series are logged:
      - moe_stability/<metric>/<tower>/layer_NNN  — per model layer time series
      - moe_stability/<metric>/<tower>/mean|max   — summary across all MoE layers
    Plus per-tower scalars:
      - moe_stability/n_eff_total/<tower>             — sum of N_eff over MoE layers
      - moe_stability/effective_params_billions/<tower> — (Shared + n_eff_total * per-expert
        params) / 1e9, i.e. in billions so a log-scale axis reads 1B, 2B, ...

    Per-layer metrics logged: dead_expert_rate, lif, router_entropy_normalized,
    soft_eff_normalized, hard_eff_normalized, router_token_mi_normalized, honest_eff_normalized.

    Typical healthy ranges:
      dead_expert_rate  → 0 (any sustained non-zero value is a concern)
      lif               → <= 1.3 (alarm at > 3.0)
      router_entropy_normalized → > 0.7 (collapse if it drops sharply)
      soft_eff_normalized, hard_eff_normalized → high; a large gap between
        them (e.g. soft high, hard low) indicates hidden top-k concentration
      router_token_mi_normalized → higher means routing is genuinely token-conditional
      honest_eff_normalized → higher (toward 1) means more experts honestly used;
        a falling value / effective_params indicates the router is collapsing toward k/N
